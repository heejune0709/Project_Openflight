# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    Our team plans to meet at least twice a week, and each meeting will take about an hour and a half to two hours. Our team prefers to meet in person for the meeting but communicates using slack for minor reasons and feedback. After each meeting, we plan to record some key points we talked about via slack, and at the end of the meeting, we will also record our goal until the next meeting. 
2. **Assistance** 
    
    As mentioned, we will mostly depend on slack if assistance is needed. We have also exchanged phone numbers to message/call each other if a quick response is required. 
3. **Respect** 

    Our team enforces that all team members will be respected during the project. As there are currently only three members in the team, each member will be required and be allowed to express ideas and opinions freely without interruptions. Fully engaging and attentively listening during the meeting would be of utmost importance. 
    
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    Our team will assign project work by taking into account the strengths and preferences of each member. The tasks will be distributed voluntarily initially, but if needed, they will be randomly allocated to each team member to ensure a fair distribution of work. We aim to create a motivated and productive team by matching tasks with individual skills and interests. We will also consider any time commitments or preferred working hours that team members may have. If any unexpected challenges arise, all team members will provide assistance, and we will reassess the workload to ensure a balanced and manageable distribution for everyone involved.
    
5. **Time Commitment** 

    To ensure that all team members contribute to the project, we require a minimum commitment of 4 hours per week. However, we understand that team members may have prior time commitments, and we will be flexible in accommodating those. If any new conflicts or commitments arise, we encourage open communication and will work together to find a solution that allows the team member to meet their other obligations while contributing to the project. Team members must communicate any changes in their availability promptly, so we can adjust our plans accordingly.
    
6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    In a disagreement, each member should present logical reasoning to help resolve the issue. Similarly, if a team member habitually fails to complete their tasks or is consistently late, they should provide valid excuses. However, if the issue cannot be resolved, we will seek help from the course staff.
