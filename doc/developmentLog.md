## Development Log

**Week 1 (March 20 ~ March 26):**
Development: We have finalized our 3 deliverables and completed the Team Contract and Project Proposal together. We have also divided the work accordingly and set up our computer environment. There was no harship for this week. 

March 20th: Decided which dataset to use and discussed Team contract. 
March 24th: Discussed the method of the algorithm to achieve our project goal.
March 25th: Finalized our major deliverables, algorithms, and our timeline. We have also revised our Final Project Proposal and submitted it to PrairieLearn.

**Week 2 (March 27 ~ April 2)**
Development: We firstly discuss about how to make graph and moved on to finalize the initial repository and code structure outline. 

March 28th: Complete converting data to proper array format and use the array data to graph format. 
March 30th: Started individual work on implementing 3 different deliverables. 

**Week 3 (April 3 ~ April 9)**
Development: We have met up with the deliverables we have implemented but we faced difficulties in making the make file and testing out if our method was correctly implemented. We have decided to reasearch on this so we can debug later. 

April 4th: Try to finalize BFS traversals and start Dijkstra’s as Page rank algorithm was still in progress. 
April 6th: Try to finalize Dijstra’s with a verification test. Modification on BFS traversals if needed but both didn't work as we faced some difficulties making makefile. 

**Week 4 (April 10 ~ April 16)**
Development: We have finalized our airport class and was still figuring out the makefile. Moreover, for midpoint check up, we have finalized our 2 deliverables and got ready to present our progress. 

April 11th: Finish the airport class. 
April 13th: Ready for the midway check for our project. Modify algorithms if necessary. 

**Week 5 (April 17 ~ April 23)**
Development: After meeting our mentor, we were able to finalize all 3 deliverables and tested out if they were working the right way. However, due to shortage of time we have decided to give up on making visualizations and focus more on completing the project itself. 

April 18th: Try writing complete test cases for testing out the project as a whole. 
April 20th: Make main.cpp -> testing the codes to get result

**Week 6 (April 24 ~ May 5)**
Development: 

April 24th: Try to draw conclusion and write for final report. 
May 2nd: Final review from the beginning and get ready for the presentation. 
May 4th: Complete the project and submit it.
