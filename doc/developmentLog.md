## Development Log

**Week 1 (March 20 ~ March 26):**
Development: Our team finalized the three deliverables, completed the Team Contract and Project Proposal, and assigned tasks accordingly. We also set up our computer environment. No difficulties were encountered this week.

- Goals: Finalize deliverables, complete Team Contract and Project Proposal, and set up computer environment.
- Tasks: Deciding on the dataset, discussing the Team Contract, finalizing major deliverables, algorithms, and timeline, and submitting the Final Project Proposal.
Problems: None.
- Next week's plan: Discuss graph creation and finalize the initial repository and code structure outline.


**Week 2 (March 27 ~ April 2)**
Development: We discussed graph creation and finalized the initial repository and code structure outline.

- Goals: Complete data conversion to array format and start individual work on implementing the three deliverables.
- Tasks: Converting data to array format, creating graphs from array data, and starting work on the three deliverables.
- Problems: None.
- Next week's plan: Finalize BFS traversals and start Dijkstra's Algorithm while working on the PageRank Algorithm.

**Week 3 (April 3 ~ April 9)**
Development: We implemented the deliverables but faced difficulties creating the Makefile and verifying our methods. We decided to research this for debugging later.

- Goals: Finalize BFS traversals and start Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Tasks: Attempting to finalize BFS traversals and Dijkstra's Algorithm with verification tests, but encountered Makefile issues.
- Problems: Difficulties creating Makefile.
- Next week's plan: Finalize the Airport class and prepare for the midway project check.

**Week 4 (April 10 ~ April 16)**
Development: We finalized our Airport class and continued working on the Makefile. We also completed two deliverables for the midway project check.

- Goals: Finish the Airport class and prepare for the midway project check.
- Tasks: Completing the Airport class and preparing for the midway project check by finalizing two deliverables.
- Problems: Makefile difficulties persisted.
- Next week's plan: Complete all three deliverables and write test cases.

**Week 5 (April 17 ~ April 23)**
Development: After meeting with our mentor, we finalized all three deliverables and tested their functionality. However, due to time constraints, we decided to forgo visualizations and focus on project completion.

- Goals: Write complete test cases and work on main.cpp.
- Tasks: Writing test cases for the entire project and working on main.cpp to test the code and obtain results.
- Problems: Limited time for visualizations.
- Next week's plan: Draw conclusions, write the final report, and prepare for the presentation.

**Week 6 (April 24 ~ May 5)**
Development: Finalized our project to be ready for final submission. 

- Goals: Complete the project, write the final report, and prepare for the presentation.
- Tasks: Drawing conclusions, writing the final report, reviewing progress, and completing the project.
- Problems: None.
Next week's plan: Project submission and presentation.
